Welcome to the Customer Churning Prediction project! This project aims to predict customer churn in a business, which refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By analyzing customer behavior and patterns, we can identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

Introduction

Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses in various industries. It is more cost-effective to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, making churn prediction an essential task. This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, enabling businesses to implement targeted retention strategies.

Getting Started

To get started with the Customer Churning Prediction project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/latchenvan/customer-churning-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd customer-churning-prediction
Install the necessary dependencies (see the Installation section for details).
Obtain the required dataset or generate synthetic data.
Follow the instructions in the Usage section to run the prediction model.

Data

The dataset used in this project plays a crucial role in training and evaluating the churn prediction model. Ensure that you have the appropriate dataset before proceeding with the project. If you don't have a suitable dataset, consider exploring publicly available datasets or generating synthetic data to simulate customer behavior.

Installation

To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or later installed.
Create a virtual environment (optional): python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment: source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

To run the churn prediction model, follow these steps:

Make sure you have the dataset available in the expected format.
Update the configuration file (config.yaml) with the appropriate settings.
Execute the main script: Customer Churning Prediction.ipynb
The output of the prediction model will provide insights into customers who are likely to churn. This information can then be utilized to design targeted retention strategies.

Model Training

If you wish to train the churn prediction model from scratch or improve upon the existing model, follow these steps:

Prepare the training dataset, ensuring it contains the required features and labels.
Customize the model architecture or hyperparameters in the appropriate script.
Execute the training script: Customer Churning Prediction.ipynb
Training the model may take some time depending on the dataset size and complexity of the chosen algorithm. Be patient and monitor the training progress.

Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the churn prediction model, you can utilize various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Additionally, consider using techniques like cross-validation or train-test splits to assess the model's generalization ability. Modify the evaluation scripts as needed to suit your specific requirements.
